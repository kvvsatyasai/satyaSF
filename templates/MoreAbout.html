    <h2>About My Schooling</h2>
    <p>In my pursuit of academic excellence, my foundational education began at Koshala School in Nua Khairpali, Odisha. I embarked on a scholastic odyssey that encompassed coursework up to the 9th grade. While navigating the educational landscape, I encountered a temporary setback, resulting in the need to retake the 9th grade. This decision was driven by my commitment to mastering the curriculum and ensuring a robust understanding of the academic material.</p>

    <p>The challenges I faced were further compounded by health issues, preventing me from participating in the final examinations during my second attempt at the 9th grade. Despite these hurdles, my determination remained unwavering, fueling my decision to transition to a new educational environment for the 10th grade.</p>

    <p>In pursuit of a fresh start and a conducive learning atmosphere, I joined LPT School in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh. This change marked a significant chapter in my academic journey, offering new opportunities for growth and success. The shift in schools allowed me to refocus and channel my energies toward achieving academic milestones.</p>

    <p>Demonstrating resilience and diligence, I successfully completed my 10th-grade education at LPT School, culminating in an impressive 9.0 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). This achievement reflects not only my academic capabilities but also my ability to overcome challenges and adapt to new environments.</p>

    <p>Through these educational experiences, I have honed my skills, developed a robust work ethic, and cultivated a passion for continuous learning. My journey underscores my commitment to academic excellence and personal growth, and I look forward to furthering my education with the same dedication and enthusiasm in future endeavors.</p>

    <h2>About My Intermediate(10+2)</h2>
     <p>Continuing my educational journey, I pursued my intermediate studies at Sri Chaitanya Junior College in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh. Opting for the MPC (Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry) subjects, I navigated through a challenging yet enriching curriculum.</p>

    <p>In the first year, I scored 301 marks in the final exams without any backlogs, showcasing my dedication to academic excellence. This achievement led to my promotion to the second year.</p>

    <p>The second year posed unique challenges as the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the absence of traditional final exams. However, adapting to the circumstances, I secured a total of 711 marks through alternative evaluation methods, marking the successful completion of my intermediate education.</p>

    <p>This phase not only deepened my understanding of mathematics, physics, and chemistry but also instilled in me valuable qualities of adaptability and perseverance.</p>
